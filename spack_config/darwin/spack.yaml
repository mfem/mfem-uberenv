    # Note: unlike projects using RADIUSS Spack
    # Configs, Serac is using "$spack/.." as the root
    # of Spack cache directories. We share the goal of
    # making sure that Spack instances do not collide,
    # our choice supposes that $user_cache_path is
    # defined to that purpose, but Serac is enforcing
    # it for the cache directories.
    # The reason for not adopting the same strategy as
    # Serac is because there are other directories
    # created by Spack that need to be porperly
    # isolated. Therefore, setting the
    # "user_cache_path" properly isstill mandatory.
